Starting with BIM automation feels overwhelming. I get it. You're busy, skeptical, and worried about disrupting workflows.

After onboarding 500+ firms, I've perfected a 30-day plan that works every time. Follow this guide, and you'll see ROI before your trial ends.

Let's transform your firm, one day at a time.

## Before You Begin: The Mindset Shift

Success requires three commitments:
1. **Use it on real work** (not test projects)
2. **Track your time savings** (you'll be amazed)
3. **Share wins with your team** (momentum matters)

Ready? Let's go.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Starting Too Big
Don't try every tool at once. Master one, then expand.

### 2. Using Test Projects
Real projects = real results. Test projects = abandoned tools.

### 3. Going Solo
Share early and often. Momentum requires allies.

### 4. Skipping Documentation
Future you will thank current you for good docs.

### 5. Ignoring Resisters
Address concerns head-on. Skeptics become best advocates.
