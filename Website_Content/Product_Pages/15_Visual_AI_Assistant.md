## PROBLEM SECTION

### The Challenge:
Traditional QA/QC relies on manual checking - a process that's slow, inconsistent, and prone to human error. Critical issues slip through, leading to RFIs, change orders, and field conflicts that cost thousands.

### Pain Points:
- üò§ **Can't check everything** - Too many drawings, too little time
- üò´ **Human errors** - Even experts miss obvious issues when tired  
- üò∞ **Late discovery** - Problems found during construction cost 10x more
- ü§Ø **Knowledge gaps** - Junior staff miss what seniors would catch
