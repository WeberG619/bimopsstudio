## OUR STORY

### The Beginning

BIM Ops Studio was born from frustration. 

In 2021, our founder Rick Weber was managing BIM production for a major healthcare project when he realized his team was spending 60% of their time on repetitive tasks. Creating sheets, placing tags, checking compliance - all necessary, but soul-crushing work that kept talented professionals from actual design.

"I watched brilliant architects spend entire days doing work that should take minutes," Rick recalls. "I knew there had to be a better way."

### The Breakthrough

After months of nights and weekends developing prototypes, the first version of RapidSheetStarter reduced sheet creation time from 3 hours to 3 minutes. Word spread quickly. Within weeks, firms across the country were asking for access.

But we didn't stop there. We realized every repetitive task in Revit was an opportunity to give time back to designers. Today, our suite of 15+ tools saves firms millions of hours annually.

### Today

We're no longer just a tools company. We're pioneering the future of AI-assisted design with innovations like Visual AI Assistant - the first AI that can actually see and understand BIM models in real-time.

Our vision is simple: Let humans do what humans do best - design, create, and innovate. Let AI handle the rest.

## OUR MISSION

### Mission Statement
To empower AEC professionals with AI-driven tools that eliminate repetitive tasks, enforce quality standards, and unlock creative potential.

### Our Values

**üöÄ Innovation First**
We push boundaries daily. If it hasn't been done before, that's exactly why we'll do it.

**üë• User Obsessed**
Every feature starts with user pain. We build what professionals actually need, not what we think they need.

**‚ö° Speed Matters**
In our industry, time is everything. Every tool must deliver immediate, measurable time savings.

**üéØ Quality Without Compromise**
Fast doesn't mean sloppy. Our tools maintain the highest standards while accelerating workflows.

**ü§ù Trust Through Transparency**
We're open about our roadmap, our challenges, and our successes. No corporate BS.
